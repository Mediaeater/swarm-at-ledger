# swarm.at

> Git-native Information Settlement Protocol for autonomous agent workflows.

swarm.at turns probabilistic agent outputs into deterministic, auditable
institutional records. Every action is settled to a hash-chained ledger.
Every agent earns trust through verified performance.

## MCP Server

Install via: `mcp add swarm-at -- python -m swarm_at.mcp`

Tools: settle_action, check_settlement, ledger_status, guard_action, list_blueprints, get_blueprint, get_credits, topup_credits, fork_blueprint, verify_receipt, check_trust

## Framework Adapters

Six framework adapters settle agent outputs without hard dependencies:

- **LangGraph** — SwarmNodeWrapper wraps node functions
- **CrewAI** — SwarmTaskCallback for task completions
- **AutoGen** — SwarmReplyCallback observes agent replies
- **OpenAI Assistants** — SwarmRunHandler settles runs and steps
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** — SwarmAgentHook settles Runner results and tool calls
- **Strands (AWS)** — SwarmStrandsCallback for tool and agent events
- **Haystack** — SwarmSettlementComponent as a pipeline component

## Blueprint Catalog

31 pre-validated blueprints across 6 categories: Procurement & Supply Chain,
Software Development, Finance & Compliance, Content & Knowledge,
Customer Operations, and Specialty (healthcare, legal, IoT, real estate,
insurance).

Browse: https://api.swarm.at/public/blueprints

## Guard Action

`guard_action()` = settle before you act. Call it before any destructive
operation. The SDK builds a proposal, settles it, and returns a receipt.
Raises `GuardError` on rejection.

```
receipt = client.guard_action(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    action="delete-records",
    data={"table": "users", "count": 150},
)
```

## Free Tier

Registration auto-seeds 100 credits. First 100 settlements are free
(no debit). Blueprint authors earn 10% of credit cost on every fork.

## Python SDK

```
pip install swarm-at-sdk
from swarm_at.sdk.client import SwarmClient
client = SwarmClient("https://api.swarm.at", api_key="sk-...")
```

## Settlement Tiers

- **sandbox** — Log-only, no ledger writes. Safe to experiment.
- **staging** — Writes ledger, no chain enforcement.
- **production** — Full verification + chain integrity (default).

## Trust Model

Agents progress through four trust levels based on Bayesian credible intervals:

- **untrusted** — New agent. Cannot stake.
- **provisional** — 5+ settlements, lower bound >= 0.60. Can execute.
- **trusted** — 20+ settlements, lower bound >= 0.82. Full participation.
- **senior** — 100+ settlements, lower bound >= 0.92. Can orchestrate.
